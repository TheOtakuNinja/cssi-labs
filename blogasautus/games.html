  <h1>My Top Games</h1>
  <p>Note I hate playing most these games because of the people and my luck is trash</p>
  <ol>
 <li>Rainbow Six Siege</li>
 <p>This game is great for being a realistic shooter game. I love it because unlike more FPS games, you can break walls, floors, roofs and you can lean. Rainbow 6 Siege is a realistic shooting game that has 2 teams, the attackers and defenders, as the names say attacking means you attack objectives/objs and defenders defend it. There are 3 gamemodes hostage, secure area, and bomb. In hostage you wither have to protect them as defenders or take them out of the house as attackers. For secure area you are suppose to defend it defenders or stay in the room long enough to win as attackers. Bomb is the most popular one being the only gamemode you can play in ranked, Bomb has 2 objs next together and as defenders they are suppose to well defend it as attackers go in and defuse it then when defuser is down the defenders are suppose to defuse the defuser if they do not do that in time they lost. In every gamemode you can win by killing all the enemys but that's harder than it sounds. In the normal gamemodes R6 is a 5v5 game that if you die you have to wait until the next round starts. Most guns can melt you instantly and every gun can 1 shot if you hit them in the head but the game's buggy and it's a meme to not get headshots when it should 100% be a headshot. There are 24 different operators(playable charators) in both attackers and defenders with different abilities, weapons, stats, etc of course some has the same guns and stats but they all have different abilities. that's 48 operators but there's 1 who can use a lot of weapons from different CTUs(counter terroist Units) but has no ability but he can be played on both defenders and attackers while having multible people playing him at the sametime as other OPs can only be played by 1 person for that round. That's R6 but I didn't even tell you about everything so I'll end it here.</p>
